	<description>Integrates extra features into RimWorld:
 - Installation of new body parts (third eye, more arms, supporting organ parts, etc.)
 - Harvesting and reintegrating of all available body parts and replacing with surrogates
 - Harvesting of mechanoid body parts for simple prosthetics

 ...and some things more...

Needs "Extended Human Body Simulation" above it in your mod list to work!

Credits and Thanks to...

 - Ykara, for his/her both fantastic mods, which I used as a basis, from which my small project started that (at first not intended) grew into this mod: "EPOE (Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering)" and "Harvest Everything!"
 - Marnador, for the RimWor(l)d font.
 - Tynan, for this great game!</description>
